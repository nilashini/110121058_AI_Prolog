	Riddle:

"Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is my father’s son."

	Goal: 
Determine who "that man" is.

	Understanding the Riddle
"Brothers and sisters have I none":

The speaker has no siblings.
"That man’s father is my father’s son":

"My father's son": Since the speaker has no siblings, this can only refer to the speaker themselves.
Therefore, "that man’s father" is the speaker.
Conclusion:

"That man" is the speaker's son.

Prolog Code:
Create a file named riddle.pl and add the following code:

	Explanation of the Code:

	Facts:
male(john)., male(speaker)., male(david).: Define John, the speaker, and David as males.
parent(john, speaker).: John is the father of the speaker.
parent(speaker, david).: The speaker is the father of David.

	Rules:
father(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y), male(X).: X is the father of Y if X is a parent of Y and X is male.
son(Y, X) :- parent(X, Y), male(Y).: Y is the son of X if X is a parent of Y and Y is male.
no_siblings(speaker) :- \+ (parent(john, Sibling), parent(john, speaker), Sibling \= speaker).: The speaker has no siblings if there does not exist another child (Sibling) of John who is not the speaker.
